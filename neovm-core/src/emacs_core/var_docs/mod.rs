//! Documentation strings for built-in (DEFVAR_*) variables.
//!
//! Phase A7-A10 of the substitute-command-keys-audit-v5 R5 plan.
//! Companion to `subr_docs/' (which holds DEFUN docs). Each entry
//! is a `(name, doc)' pair lifted verbatim from a GNU Emacs
//! `DEFVAR_LISP("name", Vsymbol, doc: /* TEXT */)' block (or
//! DEFVAR_INT/BOOL/KBOARD/PER_BUFFER variant) in `src/*.c'.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! - `gnu_table.rs' is **auto-generated** by
//!   `scripts/extract_gnu_defvar_docs.py' from upstream GNU's
//!   `src/*.c'. To refresh, run the script against an updated GNU
//!   mirror.
//! - `lookup(name)' does a linear scan over the table. Lookups
//!   happen only on `(documentation-property 'foo
//!   'variable-documentation)' queries, which are user-initiated
//!   and rare. Linear scan is fine; ~820 entries today.
//!
//! ## Why grave-quoted strings (not curly)
//!
//! Same reason as `subr_docs/': GNU's `DEFVAR_* doc:' text uses
//! ASCII grave accents (`` ` `` and `'`). `substitute-command-keys'
//! converts them to curly quotes at display time per the user's
//! `text-quoting-style'. Pre-substituting here would lock in
//! `'curve' regardless of preference.
//!
//! ## Lookup precedence
//!
//! GNU has two sources and this module is the second of them, so
//! `documentation_property_plan' has two arms and no others:
//!   1. Symbol's `variable-documentation' plist property, which in
//!      GNU is written by Lisp `defvar'/`defconst'/`defcustom'
//!      (`src/eval.c:911', and only when the doc is non-nil) or by
//!      `defvaralias' (`src/eval.c:723');
//!   2. `var_docs::lookup' behind [`SnarfedVariable`], standing in
//!      for `Fsnarf_documentation' reading `etc/DOC' behind
//!      `Fboundp' (`src/doc.c:606-613');
//!   3. otherwise nil.
//!
//! Ledger 178 removed a third source that GNU does not have. Two
//! hand-typed tables in `doc.rs', `STARTUP_VARIABLE_DOC_STUBS' and
//! `STARTUP_VARIABLE_DOC_STRING_PROPERTIES', were pre-seeded onto
//! 1972 symbols' plists during bootstrap, which put them in arm 1
//! -- ahead of the gate. 35 unbound names answered with a doc where
//! GNU answers nil, and the 70 STUBS names were seeded with the
//! fixnum `0' that `src/doc.c:433-434' reserves for "no doc".
