;; Typing latency in a real TTY session, designed to be MEASURABLE.
;;
;; The previous fixture was unmeasurable for two reasons, both fixed here:
;;   1. the edit loop (~0.26B cycles) was swamped by startup (~1.4B), so the
;;      subtraction was mostly noise -> do far more iterations;
;;   2. it scrolled with `forward-line', forcing full-screen redraws that
;;      saturated the pty, which throttles the app rather than measuring it
;;      -> stay on one screen and edit in place.
;;
;; Editing in place is also what typing actually is: one line changes, and
;; redisplay updates that line.
