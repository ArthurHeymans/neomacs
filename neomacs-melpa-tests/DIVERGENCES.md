# GNU Emacs / Neomacs divergences surfaced by the MELPA parity suites

Every entry below is a place where a MELPA parity workflow gets a different
result from `emacs` and from `target/release/neomacs`. The workflows are left
**failing on purpose** with GNU Emacs's behaviour recorded as the expectation,
per `tmp/neomacs-melpa-tests-standards.md`: "Do not hide a genuine divergence by
weakening the expectation, adding `#[ignore]`, or bypassing the public route."

Each entry gives a package-free reduction, so a fix can be developed and
verified without installing any MELPA package. Run one with:

```sh
emacs -Q --batch --eval '<form>'
./target/release/neomacs -Q --batch --eval '<form>'
```

Reproduce a failing suite with:

```sh
RUST_LOG=warn NEOMACS_BIN="$PWD/target/release/neomacs" TMPDIR="$PWD/tmp" \
  cargo nextest run -p neomacs-melpa-tests -E 'test(~parity_tests::<pkg>::)' --no-fail-fast
```

## 1. A minibuffer prompt inside a keyboard macro reads stdin

GNU's `read_minibuf` (src/minibuf.c) only diverts to `read_minibuf_noninteractive`
when `(noninteractive || daemon) && NILP (Vexecuting_kbd_macro)`. A running macro
keeps the real minibuffer, and its keys come from the macro. Neomacs's
`read_minibuf`-family readers gate only on "is there an input receiver", so batch
always takes the stdin path and the prompt hits EOF.

```elisp
(defalias 'my-cmd (lambda () (interactive) (setq result (read-string "p: "))))
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c t") 'my-cmd)
(execute-kbd-macro (kbd "C-c t z z RET"))
;; GNU     => result is "zz"
;; Neomacs => (end-of-file "Error reading from stdin")
```

`execute-kbd-macro` itself works in both, and `executing-kbd-macro` is non-nil
inside the macro in both.

Affects: `aangit` (6), `abc-mode` (1), `academic-phrases` (1),
`ace-jump-helm-line` (1), `ac-helm` (6). Any package that prompts, and every
helm session — helm reads its pattern with `read-from-minibuffer`, so no helm
session can be driven in Neomacs batch at all.

## 2. `read-char` / `read-event` / `read-char-exclusive` ignore the macro

They return nil **and leave the key in the macro**, so it is then dispatched as
an ordinary command (typically self-inserting). `read-key-sequence` is correct,
and therefore so is `read-key`.

```elisp
(defun probe (character)
  (interactive (list (read-char "Query Char:")))
  (setq result (list character (key-description (this-command-keys)))))
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c t") 'probe)
(execute-kbd-macro (kbd "C-c t x"))
;; GNU     => (120 "C-c t x")
;; Neomacs => (nil "C-c t")
```

Affects: `ace-jump-mode` (7), `ace-jump-zap` (8). Any package prompting with
`read-char` — `ace-jump-char-mode` signals `(wrong-type-argument
number-or-marker-p nil)`, and word mode silently mislabels, jumps unasked, and
types the query char into the buffer.

## 3. `[t]` default keymap bindings are never dispatched

`define-key` stores the binding and `lookup-key` finds it in both editors; only
dispatch skips it, falling through to the global map. Same for
`overriding-local-map`.

```elisp
(defun probe-fallback () (interactive) (setq probe-result 'fallback))
(let ((buffer (generate-new-buffer "*probe*")))
  (set-window-buffer (selected-window) buffer)
  (set-buffer buffer)
  (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap)))
    (define-key map [t] 'probe-fallback)
    (use-local-map map)
    (execute-kbd-macro (kbd "RET"))
    (list (lookup-key map [t]) probe-result (buffer-size))))
;; GNU     => (probe-fallback fallback 0)
;; Neomacs => (probe-fallback nil      1)
```

Affects: `ace-mc` (5). Any catch-all binding used to terminate a key loop —
ace-jump, avy, hydra, transient.

## 4. `(throw 'exit …)` with no catch silently ends batch evaluation

GNU signals `no-catch`. Neomacs unwinds past `condition-case` to an implicit
top-level `exit` catch and exits 0, so the rest of the script never runs. Only
the tag `exit` behaves this way. This both truncates a batch script and reports
success, so it can hide unrelated failures.

```elisp
(progn (princ (format "%S" (condition-case e (throw 'exit 7)
                             (error (list 'caught e)))))
       (princ " then"))
;; GNU     => (caught (no-catch exit 7)) then
;; Neomacs => no output, exit status 0
```

Found via `helm-exit-minibuffer` in `ace-jump-helm-line`.

## 5. `write-region` writes `?` for every legacy coding system

`encode-coding-string` is correct in both editors; only the file-writing path is
lossy. Saving a Shift_JIS, EUC-JP, GBK or ISO-2022-JP file destroys its content.

```elisp
(with-temp-buffer
  (insert "あい\n")
  (let ((coding-system-for-write 'japanese-shift-jis))
    (write-region (point-min) (point-max) "/tmp/x" nil 'silent)))
;; bytes on disk — GNU => (130 160 130 162 10)   Neomacs => (63 63 10)
```

utf-8 and utf-8-unix are written correctly. Affects: `aa-edit-mode` (1).

## 6. `directory-files` returns undecoded bytes

File names are not decoded through `file-name-coding-system`, so a non-ASCII
name comes back as raw bytes and sorts differently.
`directory-files-recursively` inherits this.

```elisp
(directory-files DIR)  ; DIR contains "Lösung.pdf"
;; GNU     => ("." ".." "Lösung.pdf" …)          (multibyte-string-p => t)
;; Neomacs => ("." ".." "L\303\266sung.pdf" …)   (multibyte-string-p => nil)
```

Affects: `abgaben` (1).

## 7. `completing-read` forwards 7 arguments instead of 8

GNU's `Fcompleting_read` always calls `completing-read-function` with all eight
parameters (src/minibuf.c), padding omitted optionals with nil. Neomacs forwards
only what the caller supplied, so a handler declared with the full eight-parameter
arglist signals `wrong-number-of-arguments`.

```elisp
(let ((completing-read-function (lambda (&rest args) (length args))))
  (completing-read "P: " (list "a" "b") nil t nil nil "a"))
;; GNU => 8    Neomacs => 7
```

Affects: `abgaben` (2).

## 8. `string-search` rejects an explicit nil START

GNU's `Fstring_search` treats nil as 0. An omitted optional passed explicitly as
nil must behave as omitted.

```elisp
(string-search " " "a b c" nil)
;; GNU => 1    Neomacs => (wrong-type-argument fixnump nil)
```

Blast radius beyond the package: `info.el`'s `Info-follow-reference` calls it
that way with an uninitialised loop variable, so **following any `*note` cross
reference in Info fails**, with or without any package. Info *menu* items are
unaffected. Affects: `ace-link` (1).

## 9. Chained autoloads stop after one hop

When an `-autoloads.el` re-declares an autoload that another package already
declared for a different file, Neomacs leaves the symbol's function cell pointing
at the inner autoload object and the second hop is never taken.

```elisp
;; chain-autoloads.el contains (autoload 'chain-run "chain" nil t)
;; chain.el defines chain-run
(autoload 'chain-run "chain-autoloads" nil t)
(funcall 'chain-run)
;; GNU     => runs
;; Neomacs => (wrong-type-argument symbolp (autoload "chain" nil t nil))
```

Affects: `abs-mode` (1).

## 10. Face aliases are not followed

`define-obsolete-face-alias` names fail every face operation, because face lookup
does not follow the `face-alias` symbol property.

```elisp
(defface neomacs-probe-real-face '((t :background "red")) "Probe.")
(define-obsolete-face-alias 'neomacs-probe-alias-face 'neomacs-probe-real-face "1.0")
(face-differs-from-default-p 'neomacs-probe-alias-face)
;; GNU     => t
;; Neomacs => (error "Invalid face" neomacs-probe-alias-face)
```

Affects: `abridge-diff` (1), via `smerge-refine`'s use of the obsolete
`smerge-refined-change` alias. Every `define-obsolete-face-alias` in the Emacs
tree is affected.

## 11. `completion-in-region-mode-map` is empty

GNU populates it with five bindings; Neomacs leaves it empty, so no completion
navigation key works after `completion-at-point`, and the `*Completions*` help
header degrades from "Type M-RET on a completion to select it" to
"Type M-x minibuffer-choose-completion …".

```elisp
(let (out)
  (map-keymap (lambda (k v) (push (cons (key-description (vector k)) v) out))
              completion-in-region-mode-map)
  (nreverse out))
;; GNU     => (("M-<down>" . minibuffer-next-completion) ("M-<up>" . …)
;;             ("RET" menu-item "" minibuffer-choose-completion :filter …)
;;             ("TAB" . completion-at-point) ("ESC" keymap …))
;; Neomacs => nil
```

`minibuffer-local-completion-map` has `M-RET` in both, so only the
completion-in-region map is affected. Affects: `accent` (1).

## 12. `x-popup-menu` rejects the documented `POSITION` value `t`

```elisp
(x-popup-menu t '("Title" ("Pane" ("Item" . value))))
;; GNU     => nil
;; Neomacs => (wrong-type-argument listp t)
```

Affects: `ace-popup-menu` (1).

## 13. `buffer-list` ordering differs

GNU and Neomacs return the buffers in a different order, so anything rendering a
buffer menu (bs, ibuffer, ace-jump-buffer) shows a different list, and any
labelling of that list differs with it. Affects: `ace-jump-buffer` (4).

## 14. `delete-other-windows` does not move the surviving window

After `C-x 1` from a window that is not at the frame's left edge, GNU relocates
the surviving window to the frame origin and gives it the frame's width; Neomacs
leaves its left edge where it was and grows it, so the right edge ends up past
the frame. Affects: `ace-window` (1).

## Behaviour that is NOT a divergence

Recorded so nobody re-investigates them:

- `ac-capf` snapshots contain `(void-variable arg)`. That is an upstream bug in
  `ac-capf.el` (`(substring arg 0 base-size)` with `arg` never bound, reached by
  any capf with a non-zero completion base size), reproduced byte-identically by
  both editors.
- `ace-link`'s minor-mode dispatch table never matches, because `ace-link`
  applies `bound-and-true-p` to the loop variable's own name; and its org
  invisible-link filter uses `outline-invisible-p`, which does not know about
  modern org-fold. Both are upstream bugs, identical in both editors.
- `read-key` and `read-key-sequence` DO receive keys from a running keyboard
  macro in Neomacs. Divergence 2 is specific to the `read-char` family.
